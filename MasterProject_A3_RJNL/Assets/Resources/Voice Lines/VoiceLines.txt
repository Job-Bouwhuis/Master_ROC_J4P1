You're in the basement? Good. We can get started.
I expect this place to be heavily guarded, so I equipped you with a gun. It's holstered on your right hip.
I know it isn't one of those fancy guns you're used to, but it does the job for you.
Although I think I forgot something... I can't remember what.
Alright. The files you're looking for are in the office of the big guy, Mr. Blackwell.
And guess what, you were right. You do need to get to the top of the building.
Mr. Blackwell has his elevators under "maintenance", so you must take the stairs.
Try moving around now.
See that camera on your right? Looks like Mr. Blackwell is prepared, try crouching behind that lowered wall.
How generous, a pack of bandages. Pick it up, it can be very useful in tough situations.
Two this time, huh? Just shoot them, they probably won't notice a thing.
Err.. Well, what are you waiting for?! Shoot him!
Good, well now that we know the limit, I highly recommend you don't shoot more than two cameras down per floor.
Now, get going.
